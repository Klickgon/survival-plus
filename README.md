Repository for "Survival Plus", a Minecraft mod adding new mobs with custom AI behaviour and pathfinding, new enchantments, reworked gameplay aspects such as sleeping and respawn anchors, all with new gameplay systems with progressive difficulty like Base Assaults and mob spawn progression, making the survival gamemode feel fresh and giving it more longevity.

This repository always contains the most recent version, released or unreleased. While no compiled versions are released here, feel free to compile the project yourself. Always be cautious with building from a commit, it might not be tested and could result breaking the minecraft world you loaded with the mod.
